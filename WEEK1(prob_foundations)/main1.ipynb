    "**Given that the player plays at least 35 minutes in a game, what is the probability they score at least 25 points?**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is higher than the overall probability P(Points ≥ 25) because:\n",

    "- Coaches give more minutes to players who are performing well\n",
    "- There is a positive relationship between minutes and points\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical use:** Coaches and analysts use conditional probabilities to:\n",
    "- Predict performance based on playing time\n",
    "- Make substitution decisions\n",
    "- Evaluate player efficiency in different situations\n",
    "- Inform game strategy"

    "# Summary: Key Concepts Review\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Random Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A **random variable** is a variable whose value depends on random events.\n",
    "- **Discrete**: Takes specific values (dice rolls, goals scored)\n",
    "- **Continuous**: Takes any value in a range (height, time)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. PMF, PDF, and CDF\n",
    "\n",
    "**PMF (Probability Mass Function):** For discrete variables, gives P(X = x) for each value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PDF (Probability Density Function):** For continuous variables, describes probability density. Area under curve gives probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CDF (Cumulative Distribution Function):** Gives P(X ≤ x), always increases from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Expected Value, Variance, and Covariance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected value E[X]:** The average value over many repetitions. The \"center\" of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variance Var(X):** Measures spread around the mean. Shows how variable the outcomes are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Covariance Cov(X,Y):** Measures how two variables change together. Positive means they tend to increase together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Joint and Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "**Joint probability P(X, Y):** Probability that X and Y occur together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Marginal probability:** Probability of one variable, summing over all values of the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conditional probability P(A|B):** Probability of A given that B occurred. Formula: P(A|B) = P(A,B) / P(B).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
