    "**Monte Carlo simulation** uses many random samples to approximate probabilities, expected values, and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The basic idea:**\n",
    "1. Generate many random outcomes according to a probability model\n",

    "- Approximates complex probabilities\n",
    "- Works when exact formulas are difficult\n",
    "- Easy to understand and implement\n",
    "- Accuracy improves with more simulations\n",
